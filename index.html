    <p>I found this interesting I liked the way that you could hear the writers prose and it was distinctively Indian. I actually felt that I learned a lot about India from this clearly the writer loves his country and cricket. I would recommend especially if you like books which immerse you in a different environment.</p>

    <p>This book collects the scientific thoughts and evidence-based conclusions from one of the most rational and gifted minds in the recorded history of human kind. Although the book maintains the same super engaging and impressive narrative of previous books by Dr. Hawking, this ones converges specifically on his science-based conclusions about the “big questions”. He again makes his thoughts appear intuitive and simple, yet they come from the one of the most objective, impartial, rational and brilliant scientific minds the human race has ever produced.</p>

    <p>The book touches the problem, mindset and dreams of modern urban youth. It tells how they are prone to get a relationship but very vulnerable to get into a relationship.i t is a fresh change in writing and only a few other writers are penning down the exact picture of 90's kids. Book also gives tribute to dharamveer bharti and His classic 'gunaho ka devta'</p>

    <p>This is the best book of college life,story is going on like, you can feel it as if this is your college life,however it is written for BHU but applying to all of college students and reminds nostalgia,some people think in the book full of grammatical errors,but the write made it deliberately,because this is the pure 'banarsiya rang' ,one who belongs to northern india,he can easily understand...this books not belongs to who want to read as a story,but who wants to feel the old memories of college best life..thanks for satya vyas to present the marvelous and fascinating story.</p>
